This project aims to develop machine learning models for the accurate calibration of sensor data, specifically addressing the issue of sensor drift in IoT devices. Sensor drift, caused by environmental conditions or ageing, can lead to decreased accuracy over time. Traditional recalibration methods may not be feasible due to the large number of deployed sensors, making machine learning a promising solution to automate the calibration process. The dataset used is divided into ten batches, each representing a different measurement period and containing readings from sensors exposed to six different gases. The data analysis involves the use of Python libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib, and techniques like PCA for dimensionality reduction. The goal is to ensure that the sensors remain reliable and effective for various applications.
